# Classification-Algorithms
Implementation of Classification techniques such as Naive Bayes, kNN, Decision Trees, Random Forests and Boosting

Implemented several classification algorithms that involve both training and testing processes

Evaluated the performance of these algorithms using evaluation measures such as Accuracy, Precision, Recall and F-Measure
