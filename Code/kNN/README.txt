Environment : python 3
Input Files : project3_dataset1.txt, project3_dataset2.txt, project3_dataset3_train.txt, project3_dataset3_test.txt
Code File : knn.py
Make sure that both input files and code file are in the same folder

1. Add any other input files to the same folder which already contains above mentioned data files (dataset 1-3) and the code file (knn.py).
2. Open a terminal window in this folder.
3. Run "python knn.py".
4. Choose whether you have a single data file to run - on which program will read the name of single data file and then split the data into two parts ( training and testing data).
OR Choose to enter separate files for training and testing - on which program will read two files ( one for training data and other for testing data )   .
5. Enter the value of 'k' ( k - nearest neighbors ).
6. View the performance metric results on the terminal window.
