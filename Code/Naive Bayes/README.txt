Naive Bayes Classifier

Requirements:

Hadoop
Java 7 or higher

TO RUN:

1. To run the Naive Bayes classifier, open the command prompt in the window containing the nBayes.jar file.
2. Type in the command "java -jar nbayes.jar" and press Enter.
3. The program would ask you for input for Mode. Type in 2 for Normal mode and 1 for Demo Mode. 
4. The program would then ask you for the input file name. Type in the filename you want to run the classifier on.
   For example, if the name of the file is "dataset1.txt" then type in "dataset1.txt" and press Enter

You will be able to see the average results after the classifier has run 10-fold cross validation,
and will be able to see the Average Accuracy, Precision, Recall and F-measure.

Note: It is important that the input file is kept in the same folder as the JAR file.
